- API (1) - design of classes / functions

    - universally recognized as a well-designed API
    - requests library: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
    
    - all you care about is knowing HOW to use the available components
    
    import requests
    
    response = requests.get("my.website.com")
    print(response._content)
    
- API (2) - some set of classes / functions available for use, typically over the web
    
    - every big tech company has an API
    - facebook api, google api, meetup.com api, ...
    
    - you also care about being ALLOWED to use the components
    - you are issued a "token" that allows you access to the API
