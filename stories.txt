As a patient, I can record my blood glucose
... The data should automatically be sent to my provider (this should be automatic)
... I can see my blood glucose history (as a graph)
... I want to communicate with my provider
... I can track my medications

As a provider, I want to see my patient's activity
... I want to see their history (as a graph)
... their medications
... their diagnosis
... I can communicate with my patient
... I can make medication changes

Core app:

- list history (patient)

- graph history (history list)
    - somehow, given the patient, find all of the patient's encounters
    - and then display a view of multiple (if not all) of them
    - v0 of the graph can be very simple

- view patient (patient)
    - might be as simple as accesssing patient.medications
    - but there also might be more that we can do
